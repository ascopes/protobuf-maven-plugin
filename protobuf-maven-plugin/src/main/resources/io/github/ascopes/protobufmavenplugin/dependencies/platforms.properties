# Protoc's developers have no plans to support an ARM release of
# protoc. The Prism emulator is included in Windows 10 and Windows
# 11 to execute x86 binaries on the ARM instruction set.
# Reportedly, Windows 10 only supports 32-bit ARM emulation, whereas
# Windows 11 supports both.
# At this time, we pin to the 64 bit version since Windows 10 is
# near EOL at the time of writing, and more support in protoc
# plugins will be available by vendors for 64 bit releases.
